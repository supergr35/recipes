coala's Cook Book
=================

We had the idea to hold a coala cooking competition and this is the repository
organizing it.

The current idea is to have a collection of all entries and also to create a
cooking book of sorts that holds the first three places of each round as a best
of cooking at coala.


coala's Call for Chefs
----------------------

**The current round ends on April 29.**

If you are here to make an entry for the Call for Chefs competition,
go open a pull request with your entry as a markdown file in the format of a
detailed recipe combined with a blog post and picture.
Right now we are holding the first round so there are no stricter rules on
anything.
Add the PR to the the milestone matching the current round and wait for the
deadline to happen.

Please add your files as `/cfc/<round no>-<username>-<name_of_the_dish>.md`.

For example `/cfc/1-sims1253-miso_ramen.md`


Happy cooking.
