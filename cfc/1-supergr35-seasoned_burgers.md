#### Ingredients (Serves 3-4)
~453 grams ground beef (1 pound, defrosted. Might be able to substitute ground turkey.)
Tomato Ketchup
Worcestershire Sauce
Steak Sauce
Onion Powder
Garlic Powder
Paprika
Desired type of cheese, two slices for each patty(optional).
Condiments! (Ketchup, Mustard, Pickles, Lettuce, Etc.)
Hamburger Buns (3-4)
#### Preparation (~10 minutes if you're slow like me)
1. In a bowl, pour about 3/4 of a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce over the meat.
2. Drizzle about a tablespoon of ketchup over the meat.
3. Add a very small amount of steak sauce, at least less than the worcestershire sauce.
4. Sprinkle garlic powder over the meat as desired.
5. Sprikle onion powder over the meat as desired.
6. Add a dash of paprika for "zest".
7. Mix up all of these ingredients into the meat in the bowl until it feels a
little bit uniform(it's ground beef, after all.)
8. Divide the meat into 3 or 4 sections, depending on how many people you're
going to feed.
9. Make each section into a patty, with a flat top.
10. Make a shallow indentation in the center of each patty with your finger.
This allows the patty to retain its shape better.
11. Cook all 3 or 4 patties at the same time in a pan on medium heat.
12. Flip a patty with a spatula when the bottom of the patty looks darker than
the top. Be sure to flip the patty before it begins to feel really sticky to the pan.
13. After a minute has gone by since the flip, add the two pieces of cheese to
the top of the patty(optional).
14. Continue cooking until the new bottom of the patty looks about as dark as
the top, and remove the pan from heat. Be sure to remove the pan before the
bottom feels like it's really sticky to the pan.
15. Take the patties out and put them on hamburger buns. Place the finished
seasoned hamburgers on a plate and server with condiments.

Note: You could also make a simple side salad by putting some lettuce in a bowl.
Delicious and nutritious! (Optional)
